89_cu-works_layer0_chunk_0_0.xcf goes to art/rooms/images/89_cu-works/layer0_chunk_0_0.dds

Make sure all layers are merged and resized to the image size

If transparency, export with dxt5, otherwise with dxt1

backup monkey1.pak!!

./packpak /mnt/hgfs/Tim/Monkey1.pak art/rooms/images/89_cu-works/layer0_chunk_0_0.dds

./extractpak /mnt/hgfs/Tim/Monkey1.pak art/rooms/images/89_cu-works/layer0_chunk_0_0.dxt

The first command transform the dds file and puts it in, the second extracts it (same data, different container)
